# 2x2 Array Operations with NumPy

This Python script demonstrates basic operations on **2x2 NumPy arrays**, including:

- Element-wise addition
- Element-wise multiplication
- Matrix multiplication (`@` operator)

The program is structured into functions for clarity and reusability, and includes dimension checks for safety.

## üìÇ Features

1. **Array Setup**
   - Creates two 2x2 arrays:
     - `A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
     - `B = [[6, 7], [8, 9]]`

2. **Operations**
   - **Addition**: `A + B`
   - **Element-wise Multiplication**: `A * B`
   - **Matrix Multiplication**: `A @ B`

3. **Validation**
   - Ensures both arrays are 2x2 before performing operations.
